    <h2>How to Build Discipline as a Student</h2>

    <p>
        Discipline is not something you are born with.
        It is something you slowly build through small actions every day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many students wait for motivation before starting.
        The truth is, motivation comes after action, not before it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Start with very small habits.
        For example, study for 20 minutes a day, even when you don’t feel like it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over time, these small actions build confidence and self-trust.
        That is the real foundation of discipline.

    <h2>Why Motivation Is Not Enough</h2>

    <p>
        Many students wait until they feel motivated to start studying or
        improving their life. I used to think the same way.
    </p>

    <p>
        The problem is that motivation comes and goes.
        Some days you feel strong, other days you feel tired and lazy.
    </p>

    <p>
        What helped me was starting small actions even without motivation.
        When I act first, motivation slowly follows.
    </p>

    <p>
        Discipline is not about being perfect.
        It is about showing up even when you don’t feel like it.
