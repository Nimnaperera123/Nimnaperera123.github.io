    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I am a university student who is learning self-development
        while trying to build discipline, clarity, and confidence in life.
    </p>

    <p>
        This website is not created by an expert.
        It is my personal learning journey, shared honestly
        to help other students who feel confused or stuck.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe small habits and simple thinking
        can slowly change a person’s life.
