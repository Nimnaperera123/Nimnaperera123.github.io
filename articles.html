    <h2>How to Build Discipline as a Student</h2>

    <p>
        Discipline is not something you are born with.
        It is something you slowly build through small actions every day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many students wait for motivation before starting.
        The truth is, motivation comes after action, not before it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Start with very small habits.
        For example, study for 20 minutes a day, even when you don’t feel like it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over time, these small actions build confidence and self-trust.
        That is the real foundation of discipline.
